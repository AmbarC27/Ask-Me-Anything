# Ask-Me-Anything

Using ChatGPT can often lead to vague answers, especially when you want information
regarding a very specific context. This project is an interactive search engine, but on documents
on which you specifically decde to train your data on. This could be confidential information
or any topic on which you believe online large language models didn't have enough data to
train on.

As a student, one of my personal uses of this project would be to train the chatbot on my personal notes
and ask questions from it to help me locate and understand topics on which I want further information.

At the time of making this project, I am not aware of any free publicly available software which does the 
same job as this project, but my guess would be that such applications would be ubiquitous
